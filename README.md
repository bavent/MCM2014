# The Best There Ever Was
## A Mathematical Model for Ranking NCAA Coaches Across Sports and Time

A dump work from the 2014 COMAP "Mathematical Contest in Modeling", to address:

>PROBLEM B: College Coaching Legends

>Sports Illustrated, a magazine for sports enthusiasts, is looking for the “best all time college coach” male or female for the previous century. Build a mathematical model to choose the best college coach or coaches (past or present) from among either male or female coaches in such sports as college hockey or field hockey, football, baseball or softball, basketball, or soccer. Does it make a difference which time line horizon that you use in your analysis, i.e., does coaching in 1913 differ from coaching in 2013? Clearly articulate your metrics for assessment. Discuss how your model can be applied in general across both genders and all possible sports. Present your model’s top 5 coaches in each of 3 different sports.

>In addition to the MCM format and requirements, prepare a 1-2 page article for Sports Illustrated that explains your results and includes a non-technical explanation of your mathematical model that sports fans will understand.

The file "MCM Report - Best College Coaches.pdf" contains the full write-up of our project design, methods, and results.
